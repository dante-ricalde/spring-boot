I have read: http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/ (100%)
I have generated a very basic project using SPRING INITIALIZR and I have started using the Boot Dashborad from STS (100%)
I am goind to generate a web project to test it using SPRING INITIALIZER (100%)
I need to study all the documentation about spring boot: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/
	I have left at: IX. ‘How-to’ guides
		(in the index part)
I need to install the Spring Boot CLI to operate the projects from command line instead of using the Boot Dashboard from STS
